# Coronary Heart Disease

## Overview 

Cardiovascular (heart) diseases are a leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year and imposing a significant burden on public health systems (WHO, 2023). Cardiometabolic, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors are major drivers of heart diseases.

According to WHO, timely and accurate prediction of heart diseases likelihood can play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources. There are four main types of cardiovascular diseases i.e.,: coronary heart diease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and aortic disease (NHS, 2023).

## Problem statement

Heart diseases are a leading cause of premature death globally and are on the rise worldwide due to behavioural risk factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids and overweight, and obesity. According to WHO these “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.

According to WHO, 4 out of 5 of heart disease deaths are premature i.e. occuring in people under 70 years. Additionally, positive change of behavioural factors in individuals has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.

In this project, by using dataset attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical parameters, we aim to create predictive models capable of identifying individuals at high risk of developing heart-related complications.

## Project objectives

* Assist healthcare professionals in early detection and proactive management of coronary heart disease.

* Prioretize high-risk patients for further diagnostic evaluations and interventions, the predictive models can contribute to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

* Uncover meaningful patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease, enable targeted preventive measures and personalized treatment plans.
