    "Cardiovascular (heart) diseases are a leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year and imposing a significant burden on public health systems (WHO, 2023). Cardiometabolic, behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors are major drivers of heart diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to WHO, timely and accurate prediction of heart diseases likelihood can play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources. There are four main types of cardiovascular diseases i.e.,: coronary heart diease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and aortic disease (NHS, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be focussing on coronary heart disease (CHD). We will leverage a publicly available Heart disease dataset containing various health-related features to develop predictive models that can assess the risk of CHD in patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to build a comprehensive heart disease prediction system that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk of developing CHD related complications to enable early intervention."

    "Heart diseases are a leading cause of premature death globally and are on the rise worldwide due to behavioural risk factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids and overweight, and obesity. According to WHO these “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to WHO, 4 out of 5 of heart disease deaths are premature i.e. occuring in people under 70 years. Additionally, positive change of behavioural factors in individuals has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, by using dataset attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical parameters, we aim to create predictive models capable of identifying individuals at high risk of developing heart-related complications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's main aim is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assist healthcare professionals in early detection and proactive management of coronary heart disease.\n",
    "* By prioritizing high-risk patients for further diagnostic evaluations and interventions, the predictive models can contribute to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\n",
    "* Uncover meaningful patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease, enabling targeted preventive measures and personalized treatment plans."

    "Heart diseases encompass a group of disorders that affect the heart and blood vessels, leading to various complications such as heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. They represent a significant global health challenge and are responsible for a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Global Prevalence:\n",
    "Heart diseases are a leading cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 17.9 million people die from CVDs every year, accounting for approximately 31% of all global deaths. The prevalence of CVDs varies across regions, with a high burden increasingly being observed in low- and middle-income countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Causes:\n",
    "Several key risk factors contribute to the development of heart related diseases. The major modifiable risk factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High Blood Pressure: Hypertension is a significant risk factor for CVDs, leading to increased stress on the heart and blood vessels.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unhealthy Diet: Diets high in salt, saturated and trans fats, and low in fruits and vegetables contribute to CVD development.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physical Inactivity: Lack of regular physical activity is associated with an increased risk of heart diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tobacco Use: Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke significantly elevate the risk of CVDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obesity: Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for various cardiovascular conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diabetes: Uncontrolled diabetes is a potent risk factor for heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Excessive Alcohol Consumption: Heavy alcohol intake can lead to hypertension and heart muscle damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initiatives to reduce heart disease prevalence:\n",
    "To combat the burden of cardiovascular diseases, numerous initiatives have been implemented worldwide in varying degree by various countries. Some key initiatives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Public Awareness Campaigns: Governments and health organizations run awareness campaigns to educate the public about heart-healthy lifestyles and risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tobacco Control Programs: Efforts to reduce smoking prevalence and control tobacco use help in lowering CVD rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Promoting Healthy Diets: Initiatives that advocate for healthier eating habits encourage the consumption of balanced diets low in unhealthy fats, salt, and sugar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Physical Activity Promotion: Encouraging regular physical exercise and active lifestyles to improve heart health.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Access to Healthcare: Ensuring access to affordable and quality healthcare services for early diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Research and Innovation: Funding research to better understand heart dieases and develop advanced treatment options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Status:\n",
    "Despite significant efforts to combat cardiovascular diseases, they remain a major global health burden. Some progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of certain risk factors and improving treatment outcomes, but challenges persist, particularly in low-resource settings. The COVID-19 pandemic also posed challenges to heart disease management and prevention due to disruptions in healthcare systems and lifestyle changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, heart diseases continue to pose a considerable global health challenge, demanding sustained efforts to address their modifiable risk factors and promote heart-healthy behaviors. Through public health initiatives, advocacy, and research, it is possible to reduce the burden of hear diseases and improve the overall cardiovascular health of populations worldwide."
